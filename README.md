# Foodie 🍲

## 💡 Inspiration

**Stats:**

* The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that globally 1/3 of food produced for consumption never gets eaten by us.
* US restaurants generate an estimated 22 to 33 billion pounds of food waste each year. 
* Approximately 4 to 10 percent of food purchased by restaurants is wasted before reaching the consumer.

**Unsold Food:**

* Food retailers (ex: cafes, fast food chains, upscale restaurants, etc.) often have unsold surplus food which they, unfortunately, have to throw away.

**Unemployment Rates**

* Many are going hungry, especially due to the increase in unemployment rates.

## 🍴What it does

Foodie is an app that helps reduce food waste, educate users with data, and make food more affordable all at the same time!

**We have the following features:**

_Notification Feature:_ Send users notifications when restaurants post discounts. Reminds restaurants to post near closing time.

_Scanner Feature:_ Users can Scan receipts from restaurants or local food retailers, as well as their meals.

_Food stock feature:_ Restaurants can post in real-time when they have discounted food items available for delivery/pickup

**Data**

* In the profile view, you can view your weekly statistics & your monthly-yearly carbon footprint. This data is from scan receipts & meals. When you scan receipts & meals you see the impact that the food has on the environment. The water usage and the CO2 emissions of the food are shown to the user. The CO2 emissions are displayed to the user in terms of trees required to be planted, kilometers are driven in a ca, etc. so that the user can see their impact in a quantifiable and intuitive way. 

**Restaurant View**

* When you sign up as a restaurant you can make posts about special discounts in real-time. You can also have a stock that you can update according to inventory. You will also get notifications reminding you to post discounts, near closing time.
